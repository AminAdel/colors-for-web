# quick start
there is 2 files in the dist folder, insert them in your html code. you already know how to do that right?

The js file is for gradinet colors only. If you don't need it you won't have to insert that. This file needs jquery, so insert jquery before this file.

so we will have this :

```
<!-- jquery (I think any version would work) -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.min.js"></script>

<!-- webcolors : -->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="webcolors/dist/webcolors.min.css"/>
<script type="text/javascript" src="webcolors/dist/webcolors.min.js"></script>
```
